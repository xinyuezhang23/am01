# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)


# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


```{r glimpse_skim_data}
glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)
```


The dataframe cotains 193 rows and 5 columns. 'country' column has a character data type. 'beer_servings', 'spirit_servings' and 'wine_servings' have an integer data type, while 'total_litres_of_pure_alcohol' has a double data type.
None of the columns have any missing values. The data is available for 193 unique countries.


```{r beer_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=beer_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,beer_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 beer-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "People of Namibia drink the most beer. \nMost of these countries belong to Europe.",
    x = "Beer servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()
```


```{r wine_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=wine_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,wine_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 wine-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "People of France drink the most wine. \nMost of these countries belong to Europe.",
    x = "Wine servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()
```


```{r spirit_plot}
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=spirit_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 spirit-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "People of Grenada drink the most spirit. \nMost of these countries belong to Europe and Caribbean region.",
    x = "Spirit servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()
```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

Wee see that most of the top-25 countries consuming all three types of alcoholic drinks belong to Europe. It means that alcohol consumption is very popular in most European countries. Interestingly, spirits are very popular in the Caribbean region while beer and wine are not. We also see that some Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Japan are fond of spirits, while there is almost no Asian country in top beer and wine consuming countries.

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skim(movies)
```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?

The data contains 2961 rows and 11 columns. There is no missing value for any of the columns.
For 'title', there are duplicate entries present in the data as there are 2961 values and only 2907 of them are unique. Similarly, values for genre (17 unique values) and director (1366 unique values) are also repeated.


- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r}
movies %>%
    group_by(genre) %>%
    count(sort=TRUE) 
```

Comedy is the most popular genre while thriller is the least.



- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_gross=mean(gross),
            mean_budget=mean(budget),
            return_on_budget=mean((gross/budget))) %>% 
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))
```

We observe that Family genre has the highest mean gross while Thriller has the least. Also, the mean budget is the highest for Action movies while it's the least for Thriller movies.

For return_on_budget, we see that its the highest for Horror movies, which means that on average, Horror movies make the most $ at the box office for each $ of its budget. On the other hand, Thriller movies have the lowest return_on_budget.



- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(director) %>% 
  summarize(total_gross = sum(gross),
            mean_gross = mean(gross),
            median_gross = median(gross),
            std_gross = sd(gross)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>% 
  top_n(15, total_gross)
```

We see that Steven Spielberg's movies have had the highest total gross across all directors by a large margin. 
In terms of mean gross of movies, George Lucas is the most successful director out of these 15. We also observe that out of these 15 directors, movies of James Cameron have had the highest variability in gross collection, while movies of Shawn Levy have showed the least variation in gross collection.



- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 


```{r}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating),
            min_rating = min(rating),
            max_rating = max(rating),
            median_rating = median(rating),
            SD_rating = sd(rating))

 ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating)) +
 geom_density() +
 facet_wrap(~genre, nrow = 5)
```


We observe that movies of Biography genre have the highest mean rating of 7.11. Movies belonging to Musical and Romance genres have the least varibility in ratings (each having a standard deviation of 0.636). 
Although there is only one movie in the Thriller genre, it has the lowest mean rating of 4.8.



## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=cast_facebook_likes, y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Scatterplot for gross movie earnings vs facebook likes of cast members',
       subtitle = 'No significant pattern can be observed',
       x = 'Number of facebook likes that the cast has received',
       y = 'Gross earnings in the US box office ($)')

cor.test(movies$cast_facebook_likes, movies$gross)
```


We have mapped 'gross' to the y-variable and 'cast_facebook_likes' to the x-variable. As we have to see if number of facebook likes is a good predictor of a movie's gross earnigs, 'gross' is the dependent variable (Y) and 'cast_facebook_likes' is the independent variable (X).

'cast_facebook_likes' does not seem to be a good predictor for 'gross' because there is no clear relationship or pattern evident from the scatterplot.
On performing a correlation test, although we observed that the correlation is statistically significant, but the value of correlation is too low (0.213) for 'cast_facebook_likes' to be used as a predictor.





- Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r, gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=budget, y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title = 'Scatterplot for gross movie earnings vs movie budget',
       subtitle = 'Positive correlation observed',
       x = 'Movie budget ($)',
       y = 'Gross earnings in the US box office ($)')

cor.test(movies$gross, movies$budget)
```
  
We can clearly observe a positive correlation from the scatterplot between a movie's gross earnings and budget. On performing a correlation test, we observed that the correlation is high (0.641) and is statistically significant. Hence, budget is likely to be a good predictor for gross.



- Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r, gross_on_rating}
ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  labs(title = 'Scatterplot for gross movie earnings vs average IMDB rating',
       subtitle = 'Positive correlation observed for some genres',
       x = 'Average IMDB Rating',
       y = 'Gross earnings in the US box office ($)')

cor.test(movies$gross, movies$rating)
```

We observe that for some genres such as Action and Adventure, the gross earnings and rating seem to be positively correlated. However, for genres such as Biography and Mystery, the relationship between the two variables does not show a strong pattern.

On performing the correlation test, we observed that the correlation is low (0.269). Although the correlation is statistically significant, rating does not seem to be a good predictor of gross earnings as the correlation value is low.

Something strange in this dataset is that very popular genres such as Thriller and Romance have very low number of movies belonging to them.


# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mam2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}
nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector)%>%
  count(sort=TRUE)

nyse %>% 
  mutate(sector=fct_rev(fct_infreq(sector))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=sector)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = 'Number of companies per sector',
       subtitle = 'Finance has the largest no. of companies while Consumer Durables has the least',
       x = 'Count of companies',
       y = 'Sector') +
  theme_bw()
```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument inthe chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

myStocks <- c("PLOW","GOOGL","ZEUS","ORCL","FUN","ROCK","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol)

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise_each(
    funs(min,max,median,mean,sd),monthly_returns
    )
```


Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}
ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly,
       aes(x=monthly_returns))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  labs(title = 'Monthly Returns of Stocks',
       x = 'Monthly returns',
       y = 'Density')
```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

The distribution of the monthly returns for all the mentioned stocks follow an approximately normal distribution. We observe that the highest mean monthly return is 0.198 for GOOGL while its the lowest for Oracle (0.0109).

We also observe that the riskiest stock is ZEUS as the distribution of its returns has fat tails and the standard deviation of returns is the highest (0.1683). On the other hand, the least risky stock is SPY as the returns are very concentrated around the mean and the standard deviation is the least (0.0381).



Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise_each(
    funs(mean, sd), monthly_returns) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=sd,y=mean,colour=symbol)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label=symbol)) +
  labs(title = 'Risk vs Returns',
       y = 'Mean monthly returns',
       x = 'Standard Deviation of monthly returns') + theme_bw()
```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

We observe that GOOGL seems to be the best investments out of these stocks as it has the highest return and lower risk than most other stocks. 
ZEUS seems to be a bad investment as the risk is
highest but the returns are on the lower side.

For a similar level of risk, GOOGL gives a much higher return than ORCL. Additionally, ROCK gives a higher return than FUN for a similar level of risk.



# On your own: IBM HR Analytics

For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.


First let us load the data

```{r}
hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1. How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)
```{r}
Quit_employees <- hr_cleaned %>% 
  filter(attrition == 'Yes')

Quit_employees %>% 
  summarise_each(
    funs(mean,max,min,median,sd), years_at_company)

Quit_employees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=years_at_company))+
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of the no. of years worked by employees before leaving',
       subtitle = 'Right skewed distribution observed.',
       x = 'Number of years worked before leaving',
       y = 'Density') +
  theme_bw()
```

On an average, an employee leaves the company after working with them for 5.13 years. In the dataset, half of the employees who left the company did it before completing 3 years of work with them.

The distribution of the number of years worked at a company before leaving is right skewed. The mean of the distribution is 5.13 but there are many outliers towards the right and the maximum value of the number of years worked before leaving is 40.



1. How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?
```{r}
skim(
  list(hr_cleaned$age,
       hr_cleaned$years_at_company,
       hr_cleaned$monthly_income,
       hr_cleaned$years_since_last_promotion
       ))
```

By looking at the summary statistics, we can observe that the variable 'age' is closer to normal distribution as the difference between p25 and p50 (6), and p50 and p75 (7) is similar. Additionally, the difference between p0 and p50 (18), and p50 and p100 (24) is close. This means that the distribution is somewhat symmetrical and hence, closer to normal distribution than others.


1. How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(job_satisfaction) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n*100/sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(work_life_balance) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n*100/sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

```


We see that the majority of employees (60%) are either very highly satisfied or highly satisfied with their jobs. 20% of the employees have low job satisfaction and the rest 20% have medium satisfaction.

The majority of employees (60%) have 'Better' work life balance. 10% reported that their work life balance is 'Best' while 5% reported that its 'Bad'. Overall, we see that 95% of the employees have at least 'Good' work-life balance.


1. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?

```{r}
#RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MONTHLY INCOME AND EDUCATION

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(min,max,median,mean,sd),
                 monthly_income) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))
  
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(education, monthly_income), y = monthly_income, fill=education)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Monthly Income and Education',
       subtitle = 'We observe that higher education leads to higher monthly income on average.',
       x = 'Education level',
       y = 'Monthly Income') +
  theme_bw()

```


We observe a clear pattern in the relationship between Monthly income and Education. On average, a higher educated employee earns more than a lesser educated employee. Although we see that the median income of Bachelor is slightly lower than that of College, the mean income of Bachelor is higher than that for College.
We also obverse that many outliers who have education till Below College, College, Bachelor or Master level earn almost as much as the maximum paid Doctor.
Since we have outliers for almost all education levels, median would be the better central tendency measure to look at instead of a mean as median is not much affected by outliers.


```{r}
#RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MONTHLY INCOME AND GENDER

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(min,max,median,mean,sd),
                 monthly_income) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))
  
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(gender, monthly_income), y = monthly_income)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Distribution of Monthly Income and Gender',
       subtitle = 'We observe that females earns more than males on average.',
       x = 'Gender',
       y = 'Monthly Income') +
  theme_bw()
```

We observe that the mean income and median income of Females is higher than that of Males, although the difference is low. We also see that the income of the highest paid male and the highest paid female is very similar. We also observe that the first and third quartiles are higher for Females.


1. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first
```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(job_role = fct_reorder(job_role, monthly_income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = monthly_income, y = job_role, 
             fill = job_role)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = 'Boxplot of Monthly Income vs Job Role',
        x = 'Monthly Income',
        y = 'Job Role') +
  theme_bw()
```

We observe that the median monthly income of a Manager is the highest while that of a Sales Representative is the lowest. Managers are closely followed by Research directors and then there is a large income gap between Research Directors and Healthcare Representative.




1. Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.
```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income = median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(median_income))

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income = median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  mutate(education = fct_reorder(education, median_income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = education, y = median_income, 
             fill = education)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(median_income)), size=5) +
  labs(title = "Bar chart for Median Income by Education Level",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Median Income") +
  theme_bw()
```

Since we observed that many outliers are present in the data for monthly income vs education, we have plotted median income against education as median is not much affected by outliers.

We see that Doctor level employees have the highest median income by a large margin. The second highest is Master level employees which is closely followed by College and Bachelor level employees. The least median income is for Below College level, which is lower than Bachelor level by a big margin.


1. Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_density() + 
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Income by Education Level",
       x = "Count of employees",
       y = "Monthly Income")
```



1. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y=monthly_income)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~job_role, nrow=3) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Income vs Age",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Monthly Income")
```



# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```


You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgouns and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county
cdc_url <- "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
vaccinations <- vroom(cdc_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(fips != "UNK") # remove counties that have an unknown (UNK) FIPS code

# Download County Presidential Election Returns
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ
election2020_results <- vroom(here::here("data", "countypres_2000-2020.csv")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))
```




```{r}



```





# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"
# https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/who-will-succeed-angela-merkel
# https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/21/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor


# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),
         week = isoweek(end_date)
         )



```

```{r}

head(german_election_polls)

date_polls <-
  

```

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
