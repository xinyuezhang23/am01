# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alchohol consumption in different countries. The data `drinks` is available as part of the `fivethirtyeight` package. Make sure you have installed the `fivethirtyeight` package before proceeding.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
# Download data
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(drinks)

# or download directly
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")

```


What are the variable types? Any missing values we should worry about? 

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# Skimming the data set to identify missing data and characteristics
glimpse(drinks)
skim(drinks)


```

The data set contains 193 rows and 5 columns. 'country' column has a character data type. 'beer_servings', 'spirit_servings' and 'wine_servings' have an integer data type, while 'total_litres_of_pure_alcohol' has a double data type. None of the columns have any missing values. The data is available for 193 unique countries.

Make a plot that shows the top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
#Matching beer servings drunk per person to each country in descending order and show top 25
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = beer_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=beer_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,beer_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  #label graph
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 beer-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "Namibia has the highest beer consumption. \nMost of the top 25 countries belong to Europe.",
    x = "Beer servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()
```

Make a plot that shows the top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}

#Matching wine servings drunk per person to each country in descending order and show top 25
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = wine_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=wine_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,wine_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  #Label graph
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 wine-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "France has the highest wine consumption \nMost of the top 25 countries belong to Europe.",
    x = "Wine servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()

```

Finally, make a plot that shows the top 25 spirit consuming countries
```{r spirit_plot}
#Matching spirit servings drunk per person to each country in descending order and show top 25
drinks %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = spirit_servings, n=25) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=spirit_servings,y=fct_reorder(country,spirit_servings))) + 
  geom_col(fill='blue') +
  #Label graph
  labs(
    title = "Top 25 spirit-consuming countries",
    subtitle = "Grenada has the highest spirit consumption. \nMost of the top 25 countries belong to Europe and Caribbean region.",
    x = "Spirit servings drunk per person in 2010",
    y = "Country") +
  theme_bw()

```

What can you infer from these plots? Don't just explain what's in the graph, but speculate or tell a short story (1-2 paragraphs max).

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

The data shows that most of the top 25 countries consuming all three types of alcoholic drinks belong to Europe, inferring that alcohol consumption is very popular in most European countries. Interestingly, spirits are very popular in the Caribbean region while beer and wine are not. In addition, the data displays that some Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Japan are fond of spirits, while there is almost no Asian country in the top 25 for beer or wine consumption. For all three alcoholic drinks, the increase in consumption in the top 25 is gradual.

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skim(movies)
```

Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

- `gross` : The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
- `budget`: The movie's budget 
- `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast memebrs received
- `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
- `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
- `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Use your data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to answer the following:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?


- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r, genre_desc}
movies%>%
  group_by(movies$genre) %>%
  count(sort=TRUE) 
```





- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order

```{r return_budget}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_gross=mean(gross),mean_budget=mean(budget),return_on_budget=(gross-budget)/budget) %>%
  arrange(desc(return_on_budget))

# movies %>%
#   mutate(return_on_budget=(gross-budget)/budget) %>%
#   arrange(desc(return_on_budget)) %>%
#   select(genre,title,return_on_budget)
# 
# # final_combined<-left_join(a_task,b_task,by='genre')
# # final_combined


```


- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.

```{r 15_directors}
movies %>%
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(max, mean,median,sd),gross) %>%
  arrange(desc(max)) %>%
  head(15)
```

- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 
```{r ratings_distribution}
movies %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  summarise(mean_rating=mean(rating),min_rating=min(rating),max_rating=max(rating),median_rating=median(rating),SD_rating=sd(rating))

ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating))+
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(~genre,scale='free',nrow=5)
```

## Use `ggplot` to answer the following

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether the number of facebook likes that the cast has received is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. What variable are you going to map to the Y- and X- axes?
  
  
```{r gross_on_fblikes}
ggplot(movies,aes(x=cast_facebook_likes,y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  scale_x_log10()
```

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. Produce a scatterplot and write one sentence discussing whether budget is likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office.

```{r gross_on_budget}
ggplot(movies,aes(x=budget,y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  scale_y_log10()+
  scale_x_log10()
```
  
  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. Produce a scatterplot, faceted by `genre` and discuss whether IMDB ratings are likely to be a good predictor of how much money a movie will make at the box office. Is there anything strange in this dataset?

```{r gross_on_rating}
ggplot(movies,aes(x=rating,y=gross))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  scale_y_log10()
```


# Returns of financial stocks


> You may find useful the material on [finance data sources](https://mam2022.netlify.app/reference/finance_data/). 

We will use the `tidyquant` package to download historical data of stock prices, calculate returns, and examine the distribution of returns. 

We must first identify which stocks we want to download data for, and for this we must know their ticker symbol; Apple is known as AAPL, Microsoft as MSFT, McDonald's as MCD, etc. The file `nyse.csv` contains 508 stocks listed on the NYSE, their ticker `symbol`, `name`, the IPO  (Initial Public Offering) year, and the sector and industry the company is in.


```{r load_nyse_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
nyse <- read_csv(here::here("data","nyse.csv"))
```

Based on this dataset, create a table and a bar plot that shows the number of companies per sector, in descending order

```{r companies_per_sector}

#Table of the number of companies per sector, in descending order
nyse %>% 
  group_by(sector)%>%
  count(sort=TRUE)

#Plotting a bar plot for the number of companies per sector
nyse %>% 
  mutate(sector=fct_rev(fct_infreq(sector))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=sector)) +
  geom_bar() +

#Adding titles and axes labels
  labs(title = 'Number of companies per sector',
       subtitle = 'Finance has the largest no. of companies while Consumer Durables has the least',
       x = 'Count of companies',
       y = 'Sector') +
  theme_bw()

```

Next, let's choose some stocks and their ticker symbols and download some data. You **MUST** choose 6 different stocks from the ones listed below; You should, however, add `SPY` which is the SP500 ETF (Exchange Traded Fund).


```{r get_price_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Notice the cache=TRUE argument inthe chunk options. Because getting data is time consuming, 
# cache=TRUE means that once it downloads data, the chunk will not run again next time you knit your Rmd

#Geting data for 6 different stocks and 'SPY'
myStocks <- c("PLOW","GOOGL","ZEUS","ORCL","FUN","ROCK","SPY" ) %>%
  tq_get(get  = "stock.prices",
         from = "2011-01-01",
         to   = "2021-08-31") %>%
  group_by(symbol)

glimpse(myStocks) # examine the structure of the resulting data frame
```

Financial performance analysis depend on returns; If I buy a stock today for 100 and I sell it tomorrow for 101.75, my one-day return, assuming no transaction costs, is 1.75%. So given the adjusted closing prices, our first step is to calculate daily and monthly returns.


```{r calculate_returns, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
#calculate daily returns
myStocks_returns_daily <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "daily", 
               type       = "log",
               col_rename = "daily_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))  

#calculate monthly  returns
myStocks_returns_monthly <- myStocks %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "monthly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "monthly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col)) 

#calculate yearly returns
myStocks_returns_annual <- myStocks %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  tq_transmute(select     = adjusted, 
               mutate_fun = periodReturn, 
               period     = "yearly", 
               type       = "arithmetic",
               col_rename = "yearly_returns",
               cols = c(nested.col))
```

Create a table where you summarise monthly returns for each of the stocks and `SPY`; min, max, median, mean, SD.

```{r summarise_monthly_returns}
#Calculating summary stats of monthly returns for each stock
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  summarise_each(
    funs(min, max, median, mean, sd), monthly_returns
    )
```

It can be observed that GOOGL has the highest mean (0.0198) and median (0.01774) monthly returns out of all the stocks. The lowest mean monthly return is for ORCL (0.0109).

In terms of standard deviation of monthly returns, ZEUS is the most risky stock as its standard deviation is highest, while SPY is the least risky.

Plot a density plot, using `geom_density()`, for each of the stocks
```{r density_monthly_returns}
#Density plot for monthly returns
ggplot(myStocks_returns_monthly,
       aes(x=monthly_returns)) +
  geom_density() +
  
  #Faceting the plot by symbols
  facet_wrap(~symbol) +
  
  #Adding title and axes labels
  labs(title = 'Monthly Returns of Stocks',
       x = 'Monthly returns',
       y = 'Density')


```

What can you infer from this plot? Which stock is the riskiest? The least risky? 

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

The distribution of the monthly returns for all the mentioned stocks follow an approximately normal distribution.
We observe that the riskiest stock is ZEUS as the distribution of its returns has fat tails and the standard deviation of returns is the highest (0.1683). On the other hand, the least risky stock is SPY as the returns are very concentrated around the mean and the standard deviation is the least (0.0381).

Finally, make a plot that shows the expected monthly return (mean) of a stock on the Y axis and the risk (standard deviation) in the X-axis. Please use `ggrepel::geom_text_repel()` to label each stock

```{r risk_return_plot}
myStocks_returns_monthly %>% 
  group_by(symbol) %>% 
  
  #Calculating mean and std dev of monthly returns for each stock
  summarise_each(
    funs(mean, sd), monthly_returns
    ) %>% 
  
  #Plotting expected monthly return on the Y Axis and risk on the X-axis
  ggplot(aes(x=sd,y=mean,colour=symbol)) +
  geom_point() + 
  
  #Labeling each stock
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label=symbol)) +
  
  #Adding title and axis labels
  labs(title = 'Risk vs Returns',
       y = 'Mean monthly returns',
       x = 'Standard Deviation of monthly returns') + theme_bw()
```

What can you infer from this plot? Are there any stocks which, while being riskier, do not have a higher expected return?

> TYPE YOUR ANSWER AFTER (AND OUTSIDE!) THIS BLOCKQUOTE.

We observe that GOOGL seems to be the best investment out of these stocks as it has the highest return and lower risk than most other stocks. 
ZEUS seems to be a bad investment as the risk is highest but the returns are on the lower side.

For a similar level of risk, GOOGL gives a much higher return than ORCL. Additionally, ROCK gives a higher return than FUN for a similar level of risk.


# On your own: IBM HR Analytics


For this task, you will analyse a data set on Human Resoruce Analytics. The [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance data set](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset) is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.  Among other things, the data set includes employees' income, their distance from work, their position in the company, their level of education, etc. A full description can be found on the website.


First let us load the data

```{r data_load_IBM}

hr_dataset <- read_csv(here::here("data", "datasets_1067_1925_WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv"))
glimpse(hr_dataset)

```

I am going to clean the data set, as variable names are in capital letters, some variables are not really necessary, and some variables, e.g., `education` are given as a number rather than a more useful description


```{r hr_cleaned}

hr_cleaned <- hr_dataset %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    education = case_when(
      education == 1 ~ "Below College",
      education == 2 ~ "College",
      education == 3 ~ "Bachelor",
      education == 4 ~ "Master",
      education == 5 ~ "Doctor"
    ),
    environment_satisfaction = case_when(
      environment_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      environment_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      environment_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      environment_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    job_satisfaction = case_when(
      job_satisfaction == 1 ~ "Low",
      job_satisfaction == 2 ~ "Medium",
      job_satisfaction == 3 ~ "High",
      job_satisfaction == 4 ~ "Very High"
    ),
    performance_rating = case_when(
      performance_rating == 1 ~ "Low",
      performance_rating == 2 ~ "Good",
      performance_rating == 3 ~ "Excellent",
      performance_rating == 4 ~ "Outstanding"
    ),
    work_life_balance = case_when(
      work_life_balance == 1 ~ "Bad",
      work_life_balance == 2 ~ "Good",
      work_life_balance == 3 ~ "Better",
      work_life_balance == 4 ~ "Best"
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(age, attrition, daily_rate, department,
         distance_from_home, education,
         gender, job_role,environment_satisfaction,
         job_satisfaction, marital_status,
         monthly_income, num_companies_worked, percent_salary_hike,
         performance_rating, total_working_years,
         work_life_balance, years_at_company,
         years_since_last_promotion)

```

Produce a one-page summary describing this dataset. Here is a non-exhaustive list of questions:

1. How often do people leave the company (`attrition`)
```{r }
# Wei
Quit_employees<-hr_cleaned %>% 
  filter(attrition=='Yes')
Quit_employees%>% 
  summarise_each(funs(mean,max,min,median,sd),years_at_company)
# Quit_employees%>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x=years_at_company))+
#   geom_density(alpha=0) +
#   theme(axis.text =element_text(size=15),axis.title = element_text(size=15))
#Xinyue
hr_cleaned %>% 
  filter(attrition =="Yes") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=years_at_company))+geom_density()
```

1. How are `age`, `years_at_company`, `monthly_income` and `years_since_last_promotion` distributed? can you roughly guess which of these variables is closer to Normal just by looking at summary statistics?
```{r}
skim(list(hr_cleaned$age,hr_cleaned$years_at_company,hr_cleaned$monthly_income,hr_cleaned$years_since_last_promotion))

# age fits into the normal distribution
```

1. How are `job_satisfaction` and `work_life_balance` distributed? Don't just report counts, but express categories as % of total
```{r}
library(scales)
satisfaction_table<-hr_cleaned %>%
   mutate(job_satisfaction=fct_infreq(job_satisfaction),N=n()) %>%
   group_by(job_satisfaction) %>%
   mutate(count=n(),per=percent(count/N,0.1)) %>%

```

1. Is there any relationship between monthly income and education? Monthly income and gender?
```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(min,max,median,mean,sd),
                 monthly_income) %>%

#   geom_col(width=0.4)

hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(education,monthly_income),y= monthly_income,fill=education))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title='Monthly income and Education',
       x='Education',
       y='Monthly income')+theme(axis.title = element_text(size=15))

# hr_cleaned %>%

hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise_each(funs(min,max,median,mean,sd),
                 monthly_income) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))

hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_reorder(gender,monthly_income),y= monthly_income,fill=gender))+

  labs(title='Monthly income and Gender',
       x='Gender',
       y='Monthly income')+theme(axis.title = element_text(size=15))
```



1. Plot a boxplot of income vs job role. Make sure the highest-paid job roles appear first
```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(job_role=fct_reorder(job_role,monthly_income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=monthly_income,y=job_role,fill=job_role))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text =element_text(size=20),axis.title = element_text(size=20) )


#Xinyue's

#Apart from manager, the range of monthly income for various job roles becomes wider when rank is higher.
```

1. Calculate and plot a bar chart of the mean (or median?) income by education level.
```{r}
hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income=median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(median_income))

# hr_cleaned %>% 
#   group_by(education) %>% 
#   summarise(mean_income=mean(monthly_income)) %>% 
#   mutate(education=fct_reorder(education,mean_income)) %>% 
#   ggplot(aes(x=education,y=mean_income,fill=education))+
#   geom_col(width=0.5)+geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_income)),colour='black',nudge_y = 190,size=6)+
#   theme(axis.text =element_text(size=20),axis.title = element_text(size=20) )



hr_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarise(median_income=median(monthly_income)) %>% 
  mutate(education=fct_reorder(education,median_income)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=education,y=median_income,fill=education))+
  geom_col(width=0.5)+geom_text(aes(label=round(median_income)),colour='black',nudge_y = 190,size=6)+
  theme(axis.text =element_text(size=20),axis.title = element_text(size=20) )
```

1. Plot the distribution of income by education level. Use a facet_wrap and a theme from `ggthemes`

```{r}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=monthly_income,color=education))+
  geom_density(alpha=0)+
  facet_wrap(~education)+
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",axis.text =element_text(size=15),axis.title = element_text(size=15) ,strip.text=element_text(size=15),axis.title.x.bottom =   element_text(margin=margin(15,0,0,0)),axis.title.y.left = element_text(margin=margin(0,15,0,0)))
```
#Q7: As what have been interpreted before, people are more likely to have higher monthly wages if they have been educated for a longer period of time. Besides, all these five density plots are right-skewed, so there definitely are other factors that help to differentiate earnings between people having similar educational backgrounds. The graph also looks better when we apply the economist format.

1. Plot income vs age, faceted by `job_role`

```{r, fig.height=15,fig.width=10}
ggplot(hr_cleaned,aes(x=age,y=monthly_income))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~job_role,ncol=2)+
  theme(legend.position = 'none',axis.text =element_text(size=20),axis.title = element_text(size=20) ,strip.text=element_text(size=25) )


hr_cleaned %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age,y=monthly_income))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  facet_wrap(~ job_role)

# The youngest manager is 30 years old so you need to have some experiences to be a manager.
# Few people do sales representative job after reaching age of 50.
# Managers and Research Directors' salary rise sharply after reaching at a certain age.

# Challenge 1: Replicating a chart

The purpose of this exercise is to reproduce a plot using your `dplyr` and `ggplot2` skills. Read the  article [The Racial Factor: There's 77 Counties Which Are Deep Blue But Also Low-Vaxx. Guess What They Have In Common?](https://acasignups.net/21/07/18/racial-factor-theres-77-counties-which-are-deep-blue-also-low-vaxx-guess-what-they-have) and have a look at the attached figure.

```{r challenge1, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "vaxxes_by_state_red_blue_every_county_070321_1.jpeg"), error = FALSE)
```


You dont have to worry about the blue-red backgouns and don't worry about replicating it exactly, try and see how far you can get. You're encouraged to work together if you want to and exchange tips/tricks you figured out-- and even though the figure in the original article is from early July 2021, you can use the most recent data.

Some hints to get you started:

1. To get vaccination by county, we will use [data from the CDC](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh) 
1. You need to get [County Presidential Election Returns 2000-2020](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ)
1. Finally, you also need an estimate of the [population of each county](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232)
 


```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# Download CDC vaccination by county

  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  # just keep the results for the 2020 election
  filter(year == "2020") %>% 
  
  # change original name county_fips to fips, to be consistent with the other two files
  rename (fips = county_fips)

# Download county population data
population_url <- "https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/DataFiles/48747/PopulationEstimates.csv?v=2232"
population <- vroom(population_url) %>%

  # select the latest data, namely 2019
  select(fips = fip_stxt, pop_estimate_2019) %>% 
  
  # pad FIPS codes with leading zeros, so they are always made up of 5 characters
  mutate(fips = stringi::stri_pad_left(fips, width=5, pad = "0"))


         


```

```{r}

```

Although we get a different regression result, the conclusions drawn from it are the same as the original article. We believe this graph does the right job.

# Challenge 2: Opinion polls for the 2021 German elections

The Guardian newspaper has an [election poll tracker for the upcoming German election](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/20/german-election-poll-tracker-who-will-be-the-next-chancellor).
The list of the opinion polls since Jan 2021 can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election) and your task is to reproduce the graph similar to the one produced by the Guardian. 


The following code will scrape the wikipedia page and import the table in a dataframe.


```{r, scrape_wikipedia_polling_data, warnings= FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_2021_German_federal_election"

# get tables that exist on wikipedia page 
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called polls 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
polls <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE)%>% 
             janitor::clean_names())


# list of opinion polls
german_election_polls <- polls[[1]] %>% # the first table on the page contains the list of all opinions polls
  slice(2:(n()-1)) %>%  # drop the first row, as it contains again the variable names and last row that contains 2017 results
  mutate(
         # polls are shown to run from-to, e.g. 9-13 Aug 2021. We keep the last date, 13 Aug here, as the poll date
         # and we extract it by picking the last 11 characters from that field
         end_date = str_sub(fieldwork_date, -11),
         
         # end_date is still a string, so we convert it into a date object using lubridate::dmy()
         end_date = dmy(end_date),
         
         # we also get the month and week number from the date, if we want to do analysis by month- week, etc.
         month = month(end_date),

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
