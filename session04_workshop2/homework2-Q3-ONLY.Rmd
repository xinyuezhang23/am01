# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

#load lubridate
library(lubridate)

#mutate date collumns to contain dates not characters
approval_polllist<- approval_polllist %>% 
  #use mdy() as dates are in US style date format
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate),
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate)
  )

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r, approval rate plot, echo=FALSE}

approval_polllist %>% 
  #turn dates into weeks and calculate net approval rate in new column
  mutate(week = week(enddate),
         net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove) %>% 
  
  #keep only "All polls" results
  filter(subgroup == "All polls") %>% 
  
  #remove unwanted entries and columns
  unique() %>% 
  select(week, pollster, samplesize,net_approval_rate) %>% 
  arrange(week) %>% 
  
  #calculate average net approval rate for each week
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(mean_net_approval = mean(net_approval_rate),
            SD= sd(net_approval_rate),
            n=n(),
            SE=SD/sqrt(n),
  #since we don't know the population's Ïƒ we will use the t-distribution derived CIs
            t_critical=qt(0.975, n-1),
            upper_CI = mean_net_approval +t_critical*SE,
            lower_CI = mean_net_approval -t_critical*SE) %>% 

  #plot diagram using ggplot
  ggplot+
  geom_point(aes(x=week, y=mean_net_approval), color="red", alpha=0.4)+
  geom_line(aes(x=week, y=mean_net_approval),color="red", alpha=0.4)+
  
  #add regression line
  geom_smooth(aes(x=week, y=mean_net_approval),color="blue",se = FALSE)+
 
  #plot CIs
  geom_ribbon(aes(x= week,
                  ymin=mean_net_approval-t_critical*SE,
                  ymax=mean_net_approval+t_critical*SE), alpha=0.2)+
  
  #add reference line on y=0
   geom_hline(yintercept=0, lwd = 1.2,color = "orange")+
  
  #add legends
  labs(title="Estimating Approval Margin (approve - disapprove) for Joe Biden",
       subtitle = "Weekly Average of All Polls",
       x= "Week of the Year",
       y= "Average Net Approval")+
  
  #format y axis scale
  scale_y_continuous(
                    breaks = seq(-5, 30, by=5) ,
                    labels = function(x) paste0(x))+
  
   theme_bw()
    
  

  
#   summarise(total_sample = sum(samplesize),
#             week_total=sum(samplesize*net_approval_rate/100),
#             total_net_approval = week_total/total_sample ) %>% 
#   #calculate SE and CI
#   mutate(SE=sqrt(total_net_approval*(1-total_net_approval)/total_sample),
#          upper_CI = total_net_approval +1.96*SE,
#          lower_CI = total_net_approval -1.96*SE)


```

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

The difference is in the sample size available. While in week 3 we only had 4 polls to calculate the average from, in week 25 we had a record of 29 different polls to calculate the average. The bigger our sample size "n" is, (in this case the number of polls), the smaller the CIs are, given that they are calculated by subtracting and adding t_critical * s/**qqrt(n)** to the average value.
