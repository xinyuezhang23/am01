# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r}
unique(tidy_GDP_data$IndicatorName)
```


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
  cols = 4:51,
  names_to = 'year',
  values_to = 'value') %>% 
  mutate(value = value / 1e9,
         year = as.integer(year),
         IndicatorName_clean = case_when(
           IndicatorName == "Exports of goods and services" ~ "Exports",
           IndicatorName == "General government final consumption expenditure" ~ "Government expenditure",
           IndicatorName == "Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)" ~ "Household expenditure",
           IndicatorName == "Imports of goods and services" ~ "Imports",
           TRUE ~ IndicatorName
         ))
  
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```



```{r}
tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  
  filter(Country %in% country_list & IndicatorName_clean %in% c('Gross capital formation', 'Exports','Government expenditure', 'Household expenditure', 'Imports')) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, col=IndicatorName_clean)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.05) +
  facet_wrap(~Country) + 
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("Gross capital formation" = "coral",
    "Exports" = "darkgoldenrod",
    "Government expenditure" = "springgreen3",
    "Household expenditure" = "dodgerblue",
    "Imports" = "violet"
  )) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=8)) +
  
  guides(col=guide_legend(title="Components of GDP")) + 
  labs(title = "GDP Components over time",
       subtitle = "In constant 2010 USD",
       y = "Billion US$",
       x = "") +
  coord_fixed(0.01)
```



Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.
```{r}
tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list & IndicatorName_clean %in% c('Gross capital formation', 'Exports','Government expenditure', 'Household expenditure')) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  

```


> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r}
tiny_GDP_data %>%
  group_by(Country, year) %>%
  mutate(
    difference = GDP- 
  )
```



```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 


> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
