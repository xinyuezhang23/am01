# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

gender_salary_ci <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_salary = mean(salary),
    sd_salary = sd(salary),
    count = n(),
    # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
    se_salary = sd_salary/sqrt(count),
    margin_of_error = t_critical * se_salary,
    salary_low = mean_salary - margin_of_error,
    salary_high = mean_salary + margin_of_error
  )

gender_salary_ci

```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

We observe that the mean salary of males is greater than that of females, and the confidence intervals for both genders are not overlapping. We see that the maximum point of the confidence interval of females' salary is lesser than the minimum point of the confidence interval of males' salary and hence, we can conclude that the population means of salaries of males and females are statistically not the same at 95% confidence level. 


You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

Null Hypothesis $H_0$ : $\mu_{male} - \mu_{female} = 0$
Alternative Hypothesis $H_1$ : $\mu_{male} - \mu_{female} \neq 0$

```{r, hypothesis_testing_formula}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data= omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
set.seed(1234)

boot_salary_null <- omega %>% 
  
  #Specifying the variable of interest
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>% 
  
  #Hypothesize a null of no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>% 
  
  #Generating random samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  
  #Finding mean difference in samples
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

#skim(boot_salary_null)

boot_salary_null %>% visualize()

boot_salary_null %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = mean(stat), direction = 'both')

summary(boot_salary_null)

```


> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

We created a t test on mean difference between men and women salary.P value of this test is 2e-04, smaller than 0.05. Hence we can reject the null hypothesis under 95% confidence level and conclude that there is a significant difference in mean salary between men and women.  


## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

```{r, experience_CI}

experience_ci <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_experience = mean(experience),
    sd_experience = sd(experience),
    count = n(),
    # get t-critical value with (n-1) degrees of freedom
    t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
    se_experience = sd_experience/sqrt(count),
    margin_of_error = t_critical * se_experience,
    experience_low = mean_experience - margin_of_error,
    experience_high = mean_experience + margin_of_error
  )

experience_ci


```


```{r, experience_t_test}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data= omega)
```
We observe that the mean experience of males is greater than that of females, and the confidence intervals for both genders are not overlapping.The p value of t test is 1e-05. Therefore, we can conclude that the population means of years of experience of males and females are statistically not the same at 95% confidence level. 
This conclusion endangers our previous one about the difference in male and female salaries. The difference in salary may be due to the difference in experience. 



## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}
omega %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary, col=gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() 

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make this plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

Overall we witness a positive relationship between experience and salary. 
However, many women executives have experience less than 5 years and several even have zero year.This means Omega just started to promote women in the previous years. While experience of men executives are more evenly distributed. We can assume that 20 years ago there are few woman in work place than today.


# Challenge 1: Brexit plot

Using your data manipulation and visualisation skills, please use the Brexit results dataframe (the same dataset you used in the pre-programme assignement) and produce the following plot. Use the correct colour for each party; google "UK Political Party Web Colours" and find the appropriate hex code for colours, not the default colours that R gives you.


```{r brexit_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "brexit.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r load_brexit_data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
brexit_results <- read_csv(here::here("data","brexit_results.csv"))

glimpse(brexit_results)
```

```{r}
elections_pivoted <- brexit_results %>% 
  select(con_2015, lab_2015, ld_2015, ukip_2015, leave_share) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(con_2015, lab_2015, ld_2015, ukip_2015),
               names_to = 'party',
               values_to = 'voting_share') %>%

    party == "con_2015" ~ "Conserative",
    party == "lab_2015" ~ "Labour",
    party == "ld_2015" ~ "Lib Dems",
    party == "ukip_2015" ~ "UKIP"
  ))

# Challenge 2: CDC COVID-19 Public Use Data

The [CDC Covid-19 Case Surveillance Data](https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/COVID-19-Case-Surveillance-Public-Use-Data/vbim-akqf) is a case surveillance public use dataset with 12 elements for all COVID-19 cases shared with CDC and includes demographics, any exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, presence of any underlying medical conditions and risk behaviors. You can see the variables from 


```{r covid_data, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cdc_data.png"), error = FALSE)
```


There are well over 28 million entries of individual, and we will work with SQLlite database, rather than a CSV file. I would like you to produce two graphs that show death % rate:

1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
1. by age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not.


```{r covid_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_comorbidities.png"), error = FALSE)
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "covid_death_rate_icu.png"), error = FALSE)
```

To do this, you will have to think what dplyr verbs to use to select, filter, group_by, etc. You will then use the example shown in https://mam2022.netlify.app/reference/reference_sql/#establish-a-connection-with-the-sqlite-database-1 to use dplyr, dbplyr, and ggplot to produce these graphs.


# Challenge 3:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data, eval=FALSE}

tidy_GDP_data  <- 

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?


```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```



> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 


> If you want to, please change `country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")` to include your own country and compare it with any two other countries you like

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
